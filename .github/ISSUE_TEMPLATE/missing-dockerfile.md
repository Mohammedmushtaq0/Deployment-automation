## ðŸš¨ Dockerfile Missing

A recent merge into the `main` branch does not include a `Dockerfile`, and no Dockerfile exists anywhere in the repository.

Please ensure that every deployable backend service includes a valid Dockerfile.

### ðŸ“Œ Action Required
- [ ] Add a `Dockerfile` to the appropriate service or directory.
- [ ] Push it to the `main` branch via a new PR.
